									<h2>Recursion</h2>
									<p><br>
									Recursion is an important programming technique. It is a popular problem-solving strategy that uses a method which calls itself. In order for 
									recursion to be a valid solution to a problem, the following conditions must be satisfied:
									<pre>
									1. The problem must be reducible into smaller, repetitive segments.
									2. The solution's endpoint must be identifiable and allow the programmer to deal with it.
									3. The smaller segments of the solution must be able to accomplish the larger result that is required of the problem.
									</pre>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>A great real-life example of recursion is a snowflake. A snowflake has many other snowflake
									patterns within it, which have more snowflake patterns within them, and so on.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>One of the most important things to note with recursion - as with any other problem-solving method - 
									is when to use it. For one, recursion offers many benefits over non-recursive solutions. They're much simpler 
									and more concise, which makes them easier to code and understand. Furthermore, the program would 
									be correctly using abstract solution strategy of using algorithms to solve problems.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>Despite these benefits, recursion also has some downsides. Mainly, it takes up more space and 
									takes more time than non-recursive solutions. Whenever a method is called, space is needed for 
									parameters, local variables, etc. This space is released when the method returns, but a recursive 
									algorithm will need more space depending on how many nested calls it makes to itself. Furthermore, 
									there are many operations that are involved in calling a method, such as allocating and releasing memory, 
									copying values into parameters, returning from the function, etc. These operations can take a long 
									time if a method makes many nested calls to itself.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>Another important thing to note about recursion is that it is different from an iterative solution. 
									Iterative solutions use loops which go through repeatedly, with each iteration starting from the beginning 
									of the loop. Recursive solutions use a method that calls itself repeatedly.</p>
